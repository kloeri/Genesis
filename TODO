To do list for Genesis
======================

Fix autotools configuration
- Make sure everything is installed in proper directories
- Link genesis statically

Documentation
- Overall Genesis architecture
- Netlink uevent interface
- Other netlink interfaces

Event sources
- Add back netlink route events
- Fix uevent regex crap
- More event sources! application specific events would be fun and useful as well (think Apache, Maria DB, ..)
- Could we do a general tail -f like event source?
- "Normal" dependency based "event source" like baselayout

Scripts
- Allow multiple subscriptions (probably using bash arrays - bash scripts + GetMetadata needs to be fixed for this)
- Write enough scripts that we can boot machines properly using Genesis

General/core Genesis hacking
- Better configuration/option handling
- Implement logging
- Implement a command channel for Genesis - we need to be able to adjust logging at runtime, stop and start event modules and so on
- Rename /sbin/genesis to /sbin/genesis-handler and write a genesis client to communicate with genesis proper
- Add error handling
- Remove the pcre++ dependency and replace all the regex stuff with proper parsing
- Fix bash env settings (PATH, shopts and whatever else is needed)
- Go through the code and cleanup/fix all the small things that makes things explode

Tests
- There's currently no tests at all. This needs to be fixed

Proof of concept scripts
========================
- Brute force SSH detection / prevention using firewall events
- Live migration of KVM machines based on KVM RelayFS events
- Timed, user VACUUM of .mozilla/firefox/*.default/*sqlite
